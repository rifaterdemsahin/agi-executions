# agi-executions
Artifical general intelligence execution logs
This project provides a structure for logging and workflow automation using [n8n](https://n8n.io/).

## Logging Folders

- `logs/`: Main directory for all logs.
- `logs/n8n/`: Stores logs generated by n8n workflows.

## Sample n8n Workflow

A sample workflow is provided in `n8n-sample-workflow.json`. This workflow appends a log entry to `logs/n8n/sample.log` every time it runs.

### How to Use

1. Import `n8n-sample-workflow.json` into your n8n instance.
2. Run the workflow to generate log entries in `logs/n8n/sample.log`.

## Project Structure

- `logs/` - General logs folder
- `logs/n8n/` - n8n workflow logs
- `n8n-sample-workflow.json` - Example n8n workflow
